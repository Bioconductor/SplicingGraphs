Package: SplicingGraphs
Title: Create, manipulate, visualize splicing graphs, and assign RNA-seq reads
	to them
Version: 1.2.0

License: Artistic-2.0
Description: This package allows the user to create, manipulate, and visualize
	splicing graphs and their bubbles based on a gene model for a given
	organism. Additionally it allows the user to assign RNA-seq reads to
	the edges of a set of splicing graphs, and to summarize them in
        different ways.
