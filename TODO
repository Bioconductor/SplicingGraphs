o Replace the RNA-seq data used in the vignette by data that actually
  contains junction reads. The BAM files in TBX20BamSubset don't contain
  any!

o Complete vignette (get rid of all TODO from it).

o Complete man pages (get rid of all TODO from them).

o Add other counting modes to countReads(), controlled via an additional
  argument. For example:

    - Nb of unique reads per edge (the current mode, should remain the
      default).

    - Nb of unique reads per edge in the simplified graph (i.e. graph
      obtained after removing uninformative nodes).

    - Nb of unique reads per transcript.

    - Nb of "unambiguous compatible hits" per transcript. Currently done
      by hand in man page for txweight(). Could be done in a simpler way
      by looking at the reads already assigned to the SplicingGraphs.

    - Nb of unique reads per gene.
