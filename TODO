o Replace the RNA-seq data used in the vignette by data that actually
  contains junction reads. The BAM files in TBX20BamSubset don't contain
  any!

o Complete vignette (get rid of all TODO from it).

o Complete man pages (get rid of all TODO from them).

o Add other counting modes to countReads(), controlled via an additional
  argument. For example:
    - Nb of unique reads per edge (the current mode, should remain the
      default).
    - Nb of unique reads per edge in the simplified graph (i.e. graph
      obtained after removing uninformative nodes).
    - Nb of unique reads per transcript.
    - Nb of unique reads per gene.
