o Replace the RNA-seq data used in the vignette by data that actually
  contains junction reads. The BAM files in TBX20BamSubset don't contain
  any!

o Move vignette to vignettes/

o Implement rsgedgesByTranscript().

o Complete vignette (get rid of all TODO from it).

o Complete man pages (get rid of all TODO from them).

o Fix issue with calls to plotting functions requiring 1 more key-stroke than
  necessary before they actually start to plot something.

o Add other counting modes to countReads(), controlled via the 'by'
  argument. For example:

    - Nb of unique reads per transcript.

    - Nb of "unambiguous compatible hits" per transcript. Currently done
      by hand in man page for txweight(). Could be done in a simpler way
      by looking at the reads already assigned to the SplicingGraphs.

    - Nb of unique reads per gene.
